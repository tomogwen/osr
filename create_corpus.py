# goal: output into a file a 2d numpy array, with the first element containing a second two by two array
# of size [number of examples, 784], containing 78x78 images encoded with 0 or ff as intensity and the
# second element contains a 1d numpy array [number of examples] containing the label for the graph

# id | function
# --------------------
#  0 | pos. linear
#  1 | neg. linear
#  2 | pos. quadratic
#  3 | neg. quadratic
